    title: 'Basic Lathework for Home Machinists',
    description:
      "Basic Lathework thoughtfully explains all aspects of the lathe and covers the selection of a machine and its construction, from modern types of machines to more traditional models. All aspects of tooling, machining operations - including general machining, taper turning, threading, and boring - are described in depth for a full understanding of the extensive capabilities of a lathe. Author Stan Bray pays particular attention to modern applications, such as the conversion of power supplies from single to three phase, and the use of digital equipment to improve efficiency. It is suitable for beginners with no knowledge of lathework, and to those who are more advanced and want to improve their skills. With expert advice on steadies, tool height, how to use cutting fluids, mandrels, and more, you'll be able to use your lathe to its fullest potential.",

    title: 'The Milling Machine for Home Machinists',
    description:
      "This book provides the detailed knowledge you need to successfully choose, install, and operate a milling machine in your home workshop. Heavily illustrated with color photographs and diagrams, understand which accessories are essential and which can be postponed until your activity demands it. The usage of each machine and accessory is explained in detail for the vast majority of applications in an active shop. Discover options for holding the many diverse shapes and sizes of work pieces that will inevitably surface during your machine's life. This critical task is by far the most important part of learning to use the machine. The Milling Machine will arm you with decision-making skills on which method is best for any application - whether to use a vice or an angle plate, mount the piece directly onto the worktable, or even produce a fixture specifically for the task. With the work piece set up and ready for machining, this book will show you the correct ways to cut metal and maintain all your milling tools.",
